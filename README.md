<h1>🌦️ Weather Forecast Dashboard – Power BI (API-Based)</h1>
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Weather Forecast Dashboard built using Power BI, which uses a Weather API (via API Key) to fetch weather data and transform it into interactive and insightful visualizations.
The dashboard helps users analyze weather conditions, trends, and key climate indicators in an intuitive way.

🎯 Objectives

Fetch real-time / recent weather data using an API

Analyze and visualize weather parameters effectively

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for data-driven insights

📊 Features

🌡️ Temperature analysis

💧 Humidity & rainfall insights

🌬️ Wind speed and weather conditions

📍 Location-based filtering

📅 Time-based trends

📈 Interactive KPIs and charts

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop

Weather API (API Key based)

Power Query (API data extraction & transformation)

DAX (Measures & calculated fields)

🔑 API Details

Weather data is fetched using a third-party Weather API

Access is authenticated using an API Key

API calls are handled through Power Query (Web connector)

⚠️ Security Note:
The API key is not shared publicly in this repository.
Users must generate their own API key from the respective weather API provider.
